<h1>Research</h1>
<p>In this file I will showcase the ways I am going to conduct (or have conducted) research in the rest of this project. The topics that I'm going to research are whatever topics I want to learn more about </p> 

<h2>DOT Framework</h2>
<p>Unlike scientific research, ICT research is focused on the product and not on creating new knowlegde. examples of ICT research are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>investigating the stakeholders' wishes</li>
  <li>choosing the most appropriate technology for a (part of) ICT system</li>
  <li>investigating the usefulness of a certain technology or framework</li>
  <li>testing the quality of an ICT product</li>
</ul>

<p>To help with ICT research, there is the Development Oriented Triangulation (DOT) framework. It helps to structure your research and communicate about it. it consists of three levels</p>
<ul>
  <li>The "What" of your research (the domains)</li>
  <li>The "Why"of your research (the trade-offs)</li>
  <li>The "How" of your research (the strategies and methods)</li>
</ul>
